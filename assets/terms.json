    "Welcome to Asea iWork Builders Co. These are our terms and conditions of use of the appointment system, which you may access exactly by requesting the system. After being sent a One Time Password (OTP), the request for an appointment will be sent to the system to be processed after 1 to 2 business days. The time of acceptance may range to 10am to 8pm during weekdays.",
    "Moreover, after setting the appointment, the user may still cancel the set appointment by inputting the number once again and typing in the OTP sent to the number. Keep in mind however, that abuse in the system such as spamming or cancelling of appointment repeatedly may lead to not being accepted in the future."
